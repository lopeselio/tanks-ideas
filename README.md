| Tank Type               | Hull                                             | Turret                                           | Main Gun                                          | Road Wheel                                       | Commander Hatch                                      | Lights                                          | Track                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Modern Battle Tank      | Sleek, angular design with composite armor       | Low-profile turret with composite armor          | Smoothbore cannon with auto-loading mechanism     | Large, individually-sprung road wheels           | Rotating, armored commander hatch with periscopes     | High-intensity LED headlights                 | Wide, articulated tracks                     |
| World War II Tank       | Riveted steel hull with sloped armor             | Rotating turret with a cast or welded construction | Long-barreled cannon or howitzer                  | Solid steel road wheels with rubber tires       | Large, hinged hatch with vision slits                | Classic incandescent headlights                | Broad, articulated tracks                    |
| Reconnaissance Tank     | Lightweight aluminum or composite hull           | Small, unmanned turret with advanced sensors     | Coaxial machine gun or small-caliber cannon       | High-clearance road wheels for off-road mobility | Small, retractable hatch with observation devices    | Infra-red and night vision lights             | Narrow, high-speed tracks                   |
| Urban Combat Tank       | Reinforced, slab-sided hull for urban warfare    | Remote-controlled turret for urban environments | Short-barreled cannon for close-quarters combat   | Reinforced road wheels for debris clearance     | Rotating, armored commander hatch with gun port      | Searchlights and floodlights                  | Reinforced, low-profile tracks              |
| Artillery Support Tank  | Heavy, boxy hull for carrying large ammunition  | Fixed superstructure with elevated gun platform  | Long-range artillery piece or missile launcher   | Extra-wide road wheels for weight distribution  | Fixed, armored hatch for protection during firing    | Beacon lights for signaling                    | Wide, heavy-duty tracks                      |
| Amphibious Assault Tank | Streamlined hull with buoyancy compartments     | Turret with water-tight seals and ballast control | Water-compatible gun with elevation adjustments   | Specially designed flotation road wheels        | Sealed, water-tight hatch with emergency release     | Sealed, water-proof lights                    | Wide, paddle-like tracks for water mobility |

These inspirations provide a starting point for designing tanks with distinct purposes and characteristics, considering each main part's functionality and role in different scenarios.
